Malicious Cable Detector by O.MG
The Malicious Cable Detector allows you to detect all known malicious USB cables, even the extremely stealthy O.MG Cables! Additionally, the Detector functions as a data blocker for safe charging. It is easy to use: plug just the cable into the Detector, then plug the Detector into your computer's USB port. LED activit
